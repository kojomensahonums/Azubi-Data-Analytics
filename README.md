# 📊 Azubi Data Analytics – Term Deposit Prediction

This repository contains the submission for the **Azubi Data Analytics Pathway** final assessment.

## 🚀 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **predictive machine learning model** that determines whether a bank client will **subscribe to a term deposit**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

As a member of our data analytics team, your role will involve creating tools that use our operational data to help the business achieve its goals.
For this project, the objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (indicated by the variable "y" as "yes" or "no"). Your task is to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit based on the features provided in the dataset.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The following datasets were provided by the Azubi Africa team:

- `bank.csv` – A version with fewer rows for exploratory analysis and modeling
- `bank-full.csv` – A complete version of the dataset

Both datasets contain information such as:
- Client age, job, marital status, and education
- Contact communication type and last contact duration
- Campaign details (number of contacts, outcome of previous campaigns)
- Financial indicators (balance, housing loan, personal loan)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for web app deployment)
- Joblib (for saving the trained model)

## ✅ Deliverables

- A trained machine learning model (`bank_marketing.joblib`)
- A clean and interactive web application built using **Streamlit** to allow users to input client data and receive predictions
- This GitHub repository containing the code, model, and documentation

## 📈 Model Overview

The final model was trained on key client features and evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliable predictions.
